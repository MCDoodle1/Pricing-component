## My process

I started by writing the HTML and then styled the page with CSS. Most difficult part was the toggle button and adjusting the background image took me some time. 
I tried to use CSS only and tried the "Check Box Hack" but failed. Then I added the toggle functionality with JavaScript.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to make a toggle button in CSS. I tried to do the HTML/CSS-only challenge but did not get the CSS Checkbox Hack to work. I think this is because my HTML does not allow the use of ~ and/or + - selectors.
I appreciate input from anyone who can help make me achieve this.


### Continued development

In future projects I want to extend my knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 


### Useful resources

- [Envatotuts+](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/pricing-table-with-monthly-yearly-css-toggle-switch--cms-93335) - Helped me to add the JavaScript functionality for the week / year toggle.
- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - For everything CSS
